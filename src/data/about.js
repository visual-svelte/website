    text: "Hey! Will here. <br/><br/> Thanks for visiting Visual Svelte - a corner of the internet I use to teach myself about the magical mystical world of web development, interactivity and data visualization. <br/><br/>Specifically, I'm interested in technologies like Svelte, D3.js, Three.js, SVG and CSS and use Visual Svelte as a way to sharpen my skills in these areas. <br/><br/>I learn best through teaching, which I why some of these articles are presented as tutorials. Others are just cool things I built. <br/><br/>In building this resource, I hope to make it easier for visual storytellers to create amazing visual stories on the web, especially those without software engineering backgrounds.<br/><br/>All the code is <a href='https://github.com/visual-svelte/website' >open-source</a>.<br/><br/> If you're feeling generous (and you are able to do so), I would love it if you supported my open source work by <a href='https://ko-fi.com/visualsvelte'>buying me a coffee</a>. <br/><br/> Thanks, <br/><br/> Will ",
